Emptygold is a "nocial notwork" blog that I use as a replacement for regular social media. It's an outlet for when I don't want to be part of the toxic sludge of a modern social media timeline. No reach, no recommendation algorithms, just HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Why "Emptygold"?

[I wrote about that here.](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/posts/emptygold-blogger/)

## Why a hippo?

Because I love hippos.

## About the site

This site is set to noindex as I don't want it to be indexed by any search engines. I also have blocked several AI bots in my robots.txt file (for what use that is; better than nothing I guess?) Emptygold is accessible on the Web but this is still a relatively personal project only made for me and whomever I want to see it.

With that said, I'd appreciate it if you didn't pass on links of any pages to anyone else.
