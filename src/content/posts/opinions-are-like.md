i saw a post a few days ago where someone disagreed with the notion of saying "to each their own" regarding media and thought that, if you think something sucks, that you should stand by it and defend it with the fire of a thousands suns (heavily paraphrasing there) and i was like okay? it's possible that you know you like something and someone doesn't it's not that big a deal so yeah to each their own. or vice versa. but this idea that everyone's critiques need to be so strong one way or the other with no nuance is wild to me. a lot of critics nowadays feel like PRs or people with personal vendettas and neither are interesting.

it's perfectly reasonable to say "i liked this, other people didn't, and that's okay!"
