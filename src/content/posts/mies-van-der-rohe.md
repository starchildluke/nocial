> "We know no forms, only building problems. Form is not the goal but the result of our work. There is no form in and for itself. \[...\] Form as goal is formalism; and that we reject. Nor do we strive for a style. \[...\] It is our specific concern to liberate building activity from aesthetic speculators and make building again what alone it should be, namely BUILDING."
