I'm expected to feel bad for using air conditioning or even a fan all day when it's 30Â°C outside but it's perfectly reasonable for tech companies to build dozens of data centres for chatbots that get things wrong by design? And it's fine when tech bros use the same amount of electricity that a country uses in a year for Bitcoin or whatever?

Just don't point any of this out or you'll get people bring it back to regular citizens who are the scum of the earth for their energy consumption which is allegedly worse. Could just be them trying to survive and get joy out of life but not that's bad and Big Tech usage is vital.

They've got it backwards.
