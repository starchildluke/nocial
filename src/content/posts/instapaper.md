Since Mozilla killed Pocket, I looked for an alternative and found Instapaper (again). I used it briefly a few years ago and it's gotten a lot better. It does everything Pocket does/did but with some improvements such as not using a URL shortener and making it easier to delete stuff. And the UI is really pleasant on the eye. AND no unnecessary recommendations. Easiest transition ever.
